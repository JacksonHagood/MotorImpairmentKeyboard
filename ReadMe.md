## Needs Statement
Those with tremors or motor function impairments (such as Parkinsonâ€™s) experience trouble when interacting with traditional computer peripherals (namely a keyboard). Therefore, as use of technology becomes more prevalent, there exists a need for a simple assistive technology that provides better computer hardware accessibility to individuals with limited motor function. Existing assistive technologies are often too restrictive for those with mild to moderate motor function impairments (such as eye-trackers) and tend to sacrifice efficiency for the user. As a result, there is a need for a more traditional form of interaction that is easier for those with mild impairments to utilize. There also exists a need for a more affordable solution to this problem, as assistive devices can cost upwards of thousands of dollars, making them unattainable for a large section of the population.
